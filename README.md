# G2Ray

> Only works in places where you can open GitHub Codespaces

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**Please read this before using this project:**

This project creates and runs a V2Ray proxy server. While the intention is for legitimate use, **we strongly recommend using a separate GitHub account (not your main account) when forking and running this project**, as GitHub may restrict accounts that violate its terms of service.

## Overview

G2Ray is an automated setup for running a VLESS proxy through GitHub Codespaces. It provides a quick way to set up your own proxy server for accessing content from restricted regions.

## Setup

1. **Create or use a secondary GitHub account** (highly recommended)
2. Fork the repository to your account
3. Click the green **"Code"** button above
4. Go to the **"Codespaces"** tab
5. Click **"Create codespace on main"**
6. Wait for the setup to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

## How to Use

1. **Wait for Codespace initialization** - The setup process takes a few minutes. All dependencies and configurations will be installed automatically.

2. **Get your VLESS link** - Once ready, your VLESS proxy link will be printed directly in the terminal

3. **Import the link** - Copy the generated VLESS link and import it into:
   - V2RayNG (Android)
   - Clash Meta
   - Or any other proxy application that supports VLESS

## Important Notes

### GitHub Codespaces Quota
- GitHub provides **120 free compute hours per month** (per core)
- For a 2-core Codespace: 120 ÷ 2 = 60 hours/month
- **Stop your Codespace when not in use** to preserve your hours
- You can always restart it later when needed

### Compatible Networks
Tested on Shecan (free plan). If these IPs work for you, the proxy should be functional:
- `63.141.252.203`
- `50.7.5.83`
- `94.130.50.12`

If these IPs don't work, try different datacenters or ISPs from your region.

### Troubleshooting
- If the Codespace fails to start, try creating a new one
- Check that your GitHub account has Codespaces enabled
- Ensure you have enough compute hours remaining for the month
- For network issues, try switching proxy protocols in your client app
